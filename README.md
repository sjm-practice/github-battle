A practice application to learn react.


## Notes
* render needs to return one element
    * which can contain mulitple child elements
    * but it can not return multiple elements (or unparented children - orphans?)
* render is a pure function
    * always returns the same result when passing the same arguments
    * only may change variables within its scope
    * no side effects
* React Components should follow the FIRST acronym (per Addy Osmani)
    * Focused
    * Independent
    * Reusable
    * Small
    * Testable
*
